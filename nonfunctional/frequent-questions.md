Please describe the job you’ve applied for
 
 As an Airline Pilot, my job involves flying passengers safely, on time, in comfort, and at a profit to the employer”


Why do you want to work at this company?
 
 Aside from your company’s reputation as an industry-leader in your field, 
 the thing that excites me most about working here is your expansion plans over the next two years. 
 I’d love to work for such an ambitious business, and think that my [quantifiable expertise] would be a beneficial addition 
 to help the businesses


What is your dream job?
 
 My dream job would be one where I communicate with customers, 
 use my expertise to solve their problems and make everyone who meets me go home happy


What motivates you?
  
  went straight into IT after University, and my true motivation was realised 
  when I got to work on a project that assessed software tools against our own needs. 
  I found that I really loved translating people’s requirements into technical solutions. 
  I felt I was helping to make people’s lives easier, and at the same time 
  I got a sense of fulfilment from working out the answer to a puzzle. That’s what interests me about this role…


Why do you want to leave your current job?
 
 You’re doing a lot of biotechnology investments here. I think biotechnology is the future, and I find it fun too. 
 I do like what I’m doing now; but it’s not quite biotechnology, although it’s closely related. On a personal note, 
 I’ve always thought it best to change roles before reaching a plateau. I’ve decided now feels like the right time for a move.
