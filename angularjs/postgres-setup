Postgres

>psql postgres

postgres=# CREATE ROLE me WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'password';

postgres=# ALTER ROLE me CREATEDB;

>\du

me          | Create DB                           | {}
postgres    | Superuser, Create role, Create DB   | {}

postgres=# \q

Now we’ll connect postgres with me.
psql -d postgres -U me

Instead of postgres=#, our prompt shows postgres=> now, meaning we're no longer logged in as a superuser.

Use the \list command to see the available databases.

postgres=> CREATE DATABASE api;

Let’s connect to the new api database with me using the \c (connect) command.

Make sure not to use the backtick (`) character when creating and working with tables in PostgreSQL. 
While backticks are allowed in MySQL, they’re not valid in PostgreSQL. 
Also, ensure you do not have a trailing comma in the CREATE TABLE command.
