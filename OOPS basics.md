 The below core concepts of Object oriented Programming in the following sequence:
  1. Inheritance
  2. Encapsulation
  3. Abstraction
  4. Polymorphism

Inheritance: ( ex- family property)
 Inheritance is the process by which objects of one class acquire the properties of objects of another class. 
 It supports the concept of hierarchical classification. Inheritance provides re usability. 
 This means that we can add additional features to an existing class without modifying it.
 
 Encapsulation: ( ex- capsule wraps medicine)
	Its also know as data hiding or information hiding.
	Encapsulation is a mechanism where you bind your data and code together as a single unit. 
	It also means to hide your data in order to make it safe from any modification.
	
Abstraction:
	It basically deals with hiding the details and showing the essential things to the user
	
Polymorphism: ()
polymorphism means ability to take more than one form. 
An operation may exhibit different behaviors in different instances. 
The behavior depends upon the types of data used in the operation.

Two types of polymorphism are Runtime and compile-time polymorphism.
1)Run time poly - refers to a process in which a call to an overridden method is resolved at runtime rather than at compile-time. 
2)compile time poly - refers to a process in which a call to an overloaded method is resolved at compile time rather than at run time
