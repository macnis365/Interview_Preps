Bill Pugh suggested a concept of inner static classes to use for singleton.

    When the singleton class is loaded, inner class is not loaded and hence doesnâ€™t create object when loading the class.
    It's thread-safe because the JVM handles lazily loading the nested class.


    // Java code for Bill Pugh Singleton Implementaion 
    public class GFG 
    { 

    private GFG() 
    { 
      // private constructor 
    } 

    // Inner class to provide instance of class 
    private static class BillPughSingleton 
    { 
      private static final GFG INSTANCE = new GFG(); 
    } 

    public static GFG getInstance() 
    { 
      return BillPughSingleton.INSTANCE; 
    } 
    }
