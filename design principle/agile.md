XP programming
	
	Have the clients define their requirements in terms of simple, but specific "user stories" that describe the need from the perspective of the user.
	
	Build the software in shorter "iterations" and only mark features completed when the users have tested and accepted them
	
	Use "Continuous Integration (CI)", where developers integrate their specific branch of the code with the main code base as often as multiple times a day (instead of waiting until lots of code is written and then doing a massive hellish code merge).

Scrum Agile

	Expectation of changes in the project requirements
	
	Short development cycles
	
	Heavy client involvement throughout the project
	
	Working in small cross-functional teams ("two pizza teams" as Jeff Bezos put it, because they need to be able to share two pizzas)
	
	Each project starts with figuring out the overall scope of what's needed and the high-level design of how it'll get done(Planning)
	All the required work is broken into user stories, prioritized, and placed into the Product Backlog. 
	The backlog is broken up into short iterations (1-4 weeks) called Sprints, where the goal of each is to finish a certain number 
  of items in the backlog.
	
	 During a sprint, every day begins with the SCRUM meeting where each member of the team very briefly highlights:
	 
		What they did the day before
		What they're doing today
		What they are currently being "blocked" by (e.g. need some help with)
		
		Team members stand for the whole meeting to keep it short. 
		One member is assigned the role of the SCRUM Master and takes charge of the process. Another, called the Product Owner, advocates on behalf of the user and may be the client, a real user, or the Product Manager of the team.
		
		Each story is assigned a certain number of points related to its complexity. 
		To see how much progress they are making during the sprint, the team uses a burndown chart which shows how many points they have 
    finished relative to how many points they have left.
		
		After the sprint ends, there is a Retrospective meeting with the entire team and the client to figure out how it went and 
    what they learned. 
	
User stories - 
	
	are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability, 
  usually a user or customer of the system. They typically follow a simple template:
